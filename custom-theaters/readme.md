### Weight calibration methodology

Weights are calibrated such that if you want to run a heavy gun (LMG/MMG), you will have to sacrifice in some other areas. You could technically run an M240 (200), heavy armor (256), and the largest rig (256), but you'll be near the weight limit (=712/750) and overencumbered as a result. Weight as fairly meaningful for movement speed and stamina, so you'll have to make some sacrifices to run a heavy gun/heavy armor/heavy rigs, and can't realistically choose to run all three. There's also the "FORT" armor, which is impractical even with the lightest gun and rig, and is only really useful for a stationary gunner and for the memes.

Everything that isn't one of the following has 0 weight (no penalty):
    - Armor
    - Rigs
    - LMGs/MMGs
    - Rocket launchers
    - Heavy explosives (C4)
